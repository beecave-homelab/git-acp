# Test Plan for `classification.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module provides functionality for classifying commit types based on Git diffs and analyzing changes to suggest appropriate commit types. It defines the `CommitType` enum and functions to retrieve changes and classify commit types.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **`CommitType` Enum:**
    - **Description:** Enumeration of conventional commit types with associated emojis.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that each enum member (`FEAT`, `FIX`, etc.) is correctly defined with the corresponding emoji.
        - Test the `from_str` method with valid commit type strings and ensure correct enum conversion.
        - Test the `from_str` method with invalid strings and assert that `GitError` is raised.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` to instantiate each `CommitType` member and verify its `value`.
        - Call `CommitType.from_str` with valid and invalid inputs using `pytest.raises` to assert expected outcomes.

2. **`get_changes()`**
    - **Description:** Retrieves staged or unstaged changes in the repository.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Successfully retrieve staged changes.
        - Retrieve unstaged changes when staged changes are absent.
        - Handle cases with no changes and assert that `GitError` is raised.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Mock `get_diff` using `pytest-mock` to return controlled diff outputs.
        - Assert that the correct diff content is returned or that `GitError` is raised appropriately.

3. **`classify_commit_type(config)`**
    - **Description:** Classifies the commit type based on Git diff content using predefined patterns.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Correctly identify commit types (`feat`, `fix`, etc.) based on matching keywords in diffs.
        - Default to `CHORE` when no specific patterns match.
        - Handle invalid commit type patterns and raise `GitError`.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Mock `get_changes` using `pytest-mock` to provide specific diff contents containing certain keywords.
        - Provide various diff contents and assert that the returned `CommitType` matches expectations using `pytest`.
        - Test with invalid or undefined commit types in patterns and ensure `GitError` is raised.

**Types of Testing:**

- **Unit Testing:** Utilize `pytest` and `pytest-mock` to mock Git operations, providing controlled diffs and commit histories. Test the classification logic in isolation to ensure accurate commit type identification.
- **Integration Testing:** Use `pytest` with a temporary Git repository containing specific changes to verify that commit types are classified accurately based on real diffs.
- **Edge Case Testing:** Employ `pytest` to handle scenarios with ambiguous changes, multiple pattern matches, or empty commit histories to ensure robust classification.
- **Error Handling Testing:** Use `pytest-mock` to simulate invalid patterns or unexpected input formats and verify that errors are handled gracefully with informative `GitError` exceptions.
