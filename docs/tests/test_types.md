# Test Plan for `types.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module defines custom types and type aliases used throughout the `git_acp` package, including configuration types, Git operation types, and AI-related types. It includes the `GitConfig` dataclass and various type aliases for clarity and type safety.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **`GitConfig` Dataclass:**
    - **Description:** Holds configuration settings for Git operations, including files to add, commit messages, branch information, AI usage flags, and verbosity.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Instantiate `GitConfig` with default values and verify attribute assignments.
        - Instantiate with various parameters to ensure all attributes are correctly set.
        - Test edge cases, such as empty strings or `None` values for optional fields.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` to create instances of `GitConfig` with different parameters and assert that each attribute matches the input or default.
        - Parameterize tests with `pytest` to cover multiple instantiation scenarios.

2. **Type Aliases and Literal Types:**
    - **Description:** Defines type aliases like `CommitDict`, `DiffType`, `RemoteOperation`, and literals such as `PromptType`, `Message`, and `CommitContext` for improved type annotations.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Ensure that type aliases correctly represent the intended types.
        - Validate that literal types restrict values as expected.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` along with `mypy` to perform static type checking and verify that type aliases and literals are correctly enforced in function signatures and usages.
        - Attempt to assign invalid types to variables using these aliases and confirm that type checkers raise appropriate errors.

**Types of Testing:**

- **Unit Testing:** Utilize `pytest` and `pytest-mock` to instantiate `GitConfig` with various parameters and verify attribute values.
- **Type Checking:** Integrate `mypy` within the testing framework to ensure that type annotations are correctly applied and enforced.
