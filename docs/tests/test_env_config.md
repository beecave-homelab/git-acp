# Test Plan for `env_config.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module handles loading environment variables from the configuration file and provides fallback values from constants. It includes functions to get the configuration directory, ensure its existence, load environment variables, and retrieve specific environment variables with optional type casting.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **`get_config_dir()`**
    - **Description:** Returns the path to the configuration directory.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify it correctly returns `~/.config/git-acp`.
        - Handle edge cases where the home directory is non-standard or inaccessible.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Mock `Path.home()` to return a custom path and assert the returned configuration directory.
        - Test behavior when the home directory path contains spaces or special characters.

2. **`ensure_config_dir()`**
    - **Description:** Ensures the configuration directory exists by creating it if it does not.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Directory is created if it does not exist.
        - No error is thrown if the directory already exists.
        - Handle permission errors when the directory cannot be created.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest-mock` to mock `Path.mkdir` and simulate directory creation.
        - Simulate existing directory and verify that `mkdir` is called with `exist_ok=True`.
        - Mock `mkdir` to raise a `PermissionError` and assert that it is handled gracefully.

3. **`load_env_config()`**
    - **Description:** Loads environment variables from the `.env` file if it exists.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - `.env` file exists and is loaded correctly.
        - `.env` file does not exist; defaults are used.
        - Handle malformed `.env` files gracefully.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Mock `Path.exists` to simulate the presence or absence of the `.env` file.
        - Mock `load_dotenv` and verify it is called with the correct file path when `.env` exists.
        - Simulate `load_dotenv` raising an exception for a malformed file and ensure it is handled appropriately.

4. **`get_env(key, default, type_cast)`**
    - **Description:** Retrieves an environment variable with optional type casting.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Retrieve existing environment variables correctly.
        - Return default values when environment variables are not set.
        - Correctly cast types (e.g., string to `int`, `float`, `bool`).
        - Handle type casting errors by returning default values.
        - Edge cases: Empty strings, invalid type casts.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest-mock` to mock `os.getenv` with various return values.
        - Test different `type_cast` scenarios, including valid and invalid casts.
        - Verify that boolean casting works as expected with different string representations.
        - Ensure that exceptions during type casting do not propagate and default values are returned.

**Types of Testing:**

- **Unit Testing:** Utilize `pytest` and `pytest-mock` to test each function in isolation by mocking environment variables and filesystem interactions.
- **Integration Testing:** Use `pytest` with temporary `.env` files to test `load_env_config()` and ensure correct loading and fallback mechanisms.
