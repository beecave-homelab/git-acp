# Test Plan for `__init__.py` Files

This test plan covers the initialization files (`__init__.py`) across different modules in the `git_acp` package.

## 1. `git_acp/__init__.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module serves as the initializer for the `git_acp` package, defining the package's version and providing a high-level overview of its functionality.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **Package Metadata:**
    - **`__version__`**
        - **Description:** Defines the current version of the `git_acp` package.
        - **Test Cases:**
            - Verify that `__version__` is correctly set and follows semantic versioning.
            - Ensure that updates to the version are reflected accurately.
        - **How to Test:**
            - Use `pytest` to import the `git_acp` package and assert that `git_acp.__version__` matches the expected version string.
            - Test that version changes are correctly updated in the source code and reflected in the imported module.

## 2. `git_acp/ai/__init__.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module serves as an initializer for the `git_acp.ai` package, importing and exposing the `generate_commit_message` function from the `ai_utils.py` module.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **Exported AI Utilities:**
    - **Description:** Ensures that `generate_commit_message` from `ai_utils.py` is correctly exposed through the `ai` package.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that `generate_commit_message` can be imported directly from `git_acp.ai`.
        - Ensure that `__all__` includes `generate_commit_message` for proper namespace management.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` to import `generate_commit_message` from `git_acp.ai` and assert that it is not `None`.
        - Utilize Python's `dir()` function within tests to verify that `__all__` contains `generate_commit_message`.
        - Attempt to access non-exported members and ensure they are not accessible, asserting that appropriate `AttributeError` is raised.

## 3. `git_acp/cli/__init__.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module serves as an initializer for the `git_acp.cli` package, importing and exposing the `main` function from the `cli.py` module.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **Exported CLI Entry Point:**
    - **Description:** Ensures that the `main` function from `cli.py` is correctly exposed through the `cli` package.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that `main` can be imported directly from `git_acp.cli`.
        - Ensure that `__all__` includes `main` for proper namespace management.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` to import `main` from `git_acp.cli` and assert that it is not `None`.
        - Utilize Python's `dir()` function within tests to verify that `__all__` contains `main`.
        - Attempt to access non-exported members and ensure they are not accessible, asserting that appropriate `AttributeError` is raised.

## 4. `git_acp/git/__init__.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module serves as an initializer for the `git_acp.git` package, importing and exposing Git operations and classification functionalities from its submodules (`git_operations.py` and `classification.py`).

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **Exported Git Operations:**
    - **Description:** Ensures that all functions and classes from `git_operations.py` and `classification.py` are correctly exposed through the `git` package.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that each function (`run_git_command`, `git_add`, etc.) and class (`GitError`, `CommitType`) is accessible directly from `git_acp.git`.
        - Ensure that `__all__` includes all intended exports for proper namespace management.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` to import each function and class directly from `git_acp.git` and assert that they are not `None`.
        - Utilize Python's `dir()` function within tests to verify that `__all__` contains all intended exports.
        - Attempt to access non-exported members and ensure they are not accessible, asserting that appropriate `AttributeError` is raised.

## 5. `git_acp/utils/__init__.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module serves as an initializer for the `git_acp.utils` package, importing and exposing utility functions and types from its submodules (`formatting` and `types`).

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **Exported Utilities:**
    - **Description:** Ensures that all functions and types from `formatting.py` and `types.py` are correctly exposed through the `utils` package.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that each utility function (`debug_header`, `debug_item`, etc.) is accessible directly from `git_acp.utils`.
        - Ensure that all type definitions (`GitConfig`, `OptionalConfig`, etc.) are accessible as intended.
        - Confirm that `__all__` includes all exported members.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` to import each function and type directly from `git_acp.utils` and assert that they are not `None`.
        - Utilize Python's `dir()` function within tests to verify that `__all__` contains all intended exports.
        - Attempt to access non-exported members and ensure they are not accessible, asserting that appropriate `AttributeError` is raised.

**Types of Testing:**

- **Unit Testing:** Utilize `pytest` and `pytest-mock` to import and verify the accessibility and functionality of exported members through each `__init__.py` module.
- **Integration Testing:** Use `pytest` to combine exported members in sample workflows, ensuring they work correctly when accessed through their respective packages.
- **Namespace Management Testing:** Assert that `__all__` accurately reflects all intended exports using `pytest` to automate the checks.
