# Test Plan for `constants.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module defines all configuration constants used throughout the `git_acp` package. It loads environment variables and provides default values for various configurations, including AI settings, Git settings, file exclusion patterns, commit types, formatting configurations, and terminal settings.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **Environment Variable Loading:**
    - **Description:** Each constant should correctly reflect its corresponding environment variable when set or use default values otherwise.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that each constant retrieves the correct value from environment variables.
        - Ensure default values are assigned when environment variables are not set.
        - Test type casting for constants (e.g., `float`, `int`, `str`).
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest-mock` to set environment variables and test that constants are assigned correctly.
        - Remove environment variables and verify that default values are used.
        - Test with invalid type casts and ensure defaults fallback appropriately.

2. **Commit Types and Patterns:**
    - **Description:** Commit types should be loaded with the correct emojis, and commit type patterns should be accurately defined.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that each commit type is associated with the correct emoji.
        - Ensure that commit type patterns contain the correct keywords.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Assert that `COMMIT_TYPES` dictionary has correct key-value pairs.
        - Check that `COMMIT_TYPE_PATTERNS` contains expected lists of keywords for each commit type.

3. **File Patterns:**
    - **Description:** Excluded file patterns should accurately match files that should be excluded from git operations.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that common excluded patterns (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, `node_modules`) are present.
        - Ensure regex patterns (e.g., `/.env$`) are correctly defined.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Assert that `EXCLUDED_PATTERNS` list contains all expected patterns.
        - Test regex patterns with sample filenames to ensure correct matching.

4. **Formatting Constants:**
    - **Description:** Color settings and styles should be correctly loaded for terminal output.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that each color constant retrieves the correct color code from environment variables or defaults.
        - Ensure `QUESTIONARY_STYLE` is correctly defined as a list of tuples.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest-mock` to set color environment variables and assert that `COLORS` dictionary reflects these.
        - Check the structure and content of `QUESTIONARY_STYLE` to ensure it matches expected styling.

5. **Terminal Settings:**
    - **Description:** Terminal-specific configurations like `TERMINAL_WIDTH` should be correctly loaded and applied.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that `TERMINAL_WIDTH` retrieves the correct value from environment variables or defaults.
        - Handle invalid terminal width values gracefully.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest-mock` to set `GIT_ACP_TERMINAL_WIDTH` environment variable with valid and invalid inputs.
        - Assert that `TERMINAL_WIDTH` is set correctly or defaults when necessary.

**Types of Testing:**

- **Unit Testing:** Employ `pytest` and `pytest-mock` to mock environment variables and test that constants are assigned correctly.
- **Integration Testing:** Use `pytest` to load constants in combination with `env_config` and ensure seamless integration.
