# Test Plan for `cli.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module provides the command-line interface (CLI) for the `git_acp` package. It utilizes the `click` library to define commands and options for automating Git operations with enhanced features like interactive file selection, AI-powered commit message generation, and smart commit type classification.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **Command-Line Options and Flags:**
    - **Description:** Defines various CLI options and flags such as `--add`, `--message`, `--branch`, `--type`, `--ollama`, `--interactive`, `--prompt-type`, `--no-confirm`, and `--verbose`.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that each option correctly parses input values.
        - Test combinations of options to ensure they interact as expected.
        - Ensure that help messages and usage instructions are displayed correctly.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` along with `CliRunner` from `click.testing` to simulate CLI commands with different options.
        - Assert that the parsed options within the `main` function match the inputs.
        - Test `--help` using `CliRunner` to verify help text and option descriptions.

2. **Workflow Orchestration:**
    - **Description:** Orchestrates the sequence of Git operations and AI interactions based on CLI inputs.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Complete workflow with adding files, generating commit messages, selecting commit types, committing, and pushing.
        - Workflows with and without AI commit message generation.
        - Handling user cancellations and verifying that operations are rolled back appropriately.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest-mock` to mock dependencies such as Git operations and AI interactions.
        - Use `CliRunner` to execute commands and assert that the correct sequence of functions is called.
        - Simulate user cancellations by mocking prompt responses and verify that cleanup functions (e.g., `unstage_files`) are invoked.

3. **Error Handling:**
    - **Description:** Manages errors arising from Git operations, AI interactions, and user inputs, providing informative feedback to the user.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Simulate Git command failures (e.g., add, commit, push) and verify that error messages are displayed.
        - Simulate AI generation failures and ensure fallback mechanisms (e.g., manual commit messages) are triggered.
        - Handle invalid inputs or missing required options gracefully.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest-mock` to mock Git and AI functions to raise `GitError` and other exceptions.
        - Use `CliRunner` to execute commands and assert that the correct error messages and exit codes are returned.
        - Test edge cases with missing or conflicting options by running commands without required flags and verifying graceful handling.

4. **User Interactions:**
    - **Description:** Handles interactive prompts for file selection and commit type selection using the `questionary` library.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that interactive prompts are displayed when expected (e.g., when `--add` is not specified).
        - Simulate user selections and ensure that the selected files or commit types are correctly processed.
        - Handle user cancellations or no selections gracefully.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest-mock` to mock `questionary` functions (`checkbox`, `confirm`, `text`), simulating user inputs.
        - Assert that the CLI processes the mocked inputs correctly and proceeds with the workflow.
        - Test scenarios where users cancel prompts or make invalid selections by mocking appropriate responses and verifying behavior.

5. **Commit Message Formatting:**
    - **Description:** Formats commit messages according to conventional commits specifications, incorporating commit types and descriptions.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that commit messages are correctly formatted with commit type and description.
        - Handle multi-line commit messages and ensure proper formatting.
        - Test with and without AI-generated messages.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Mock the commit message generation using `pytest-mock` and assert that `git_commit` is called with the correctly formatted message.
        - Provide various commit message inputs through mocks and verify the output format using `pytest`.

6. **Signal Handling:**
    - **Description:** Sets up signal handlers to gracefully handle interruptions (e.g., Ctrl+C) during operations.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Simulate interrupt signals and verify that cleanup operations (e.g., unstaging files) are performed.
        - Ensure that the program exits gracefully upon receiving an interrupt.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` to simulate sending signals to the process and assert that cleanup functions are called using `pytest-mock`.
        - Mock signal handlers and verify their behavior during tests.

**Types of Testing:**

- **Functional Testing:** Utilize `pytest` in combination with Click's `CliRunner` to simulate CLI commands and verify the behavior of the CLI under various input scenarios.
- **Integration Testing:** Perform end-to-end tests within `pytest`, using temporary Git repositories to ensure that the CLI correctly orchestrates Git and AI operations.
- **Mocking:** Employ `pytest-mock` to mock external dependencies like Git operations, AI interactions, and user prompts, isolating CLI logic and simulating various scenarios without relying on external systems.
- **Error Handling Testing:** Use `pytest-mock` to simulate different error conditions (e.g., network failures, invalid inputs) and ensure robust error handling and user feedback with `pytest.raises` assertions.
- **User Interaction Testing:** Mock interactive prompts using `pytest-mock` and verify that the CLI responds correctly to different user inputs and behaviors.
