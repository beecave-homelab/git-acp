# Test Plan for `__main__.py`

**Module Overview:**
This module serves as the main entry point for the `git_acp` package, allowing it to be executed as a script. It imports the `main` function from the `cli` module and invokes it when the package is run directly.

**Functionality to Test:**

1. **Package Entry Point:**
    - **Description:** Ensures that running the package as a script (`python -m git_acp`) correctly invokes the CLI `main` function.
    - **Test Cases:**
        - Verify that executing `git_acp` as a script triggers the `main` function.
        - Ensure that the program behaves as expected when executed directly, including handling of CLI arguments.
    - **How to Test:**
        - Use `pytest` along with `pytest-mock` to mock the `main` function and assert that it is called when the script is executed.
        - Employ `pytest` fixtures to run the module as a script and verify that the `main` function performs the intended operations.
        - Test with different command-line arguments by passing them through `pytest` and asserting correct behavior.

**Types of Testing:**

- **Integration Testing:** Utilize `pytest` to execute the `git_acp` package as a script within a controlled environment, verifying that it performs the intended operations by invoking the CLI `main` function.
- **Functional Testing:** Use `pytest` to simulate various execution scenarios, including valid and invalid command-line arguments, ensuring correct behavior when the package is run directly.
- **Mocking:** Employ `pytest-mock` to mock the `main` function, verifying that it is called when the script is executed and that it handles inputs correctly.
- **Command-Line Argument Testing:** Use `pytest` to pass different arguments to the script and assert that the program responds as expected, handling both valid and invalid inputs gracefully.
